"""calculate the KLD as a measure of 'distance' between the bacteria and
the phage. 

    D(P || Q) = -sum(Pi ln(Pi/Qi)) where P = bacteria dist. and Q = phage dist.

For each metagenome we calculate Pi log(Pi/Qi), and then sum that. A
couple of obvious points: Pi and Qi need to be non zero, and KLD is
supposedly less susceptible to normalization.

We assume that the bacteria (Pi) is the real distribution and we are
trying to figure out how far the Phage (Qi) are from the bacteria.

Note that KLD is not symmetric: D(P || Q) != D(Q || P)
