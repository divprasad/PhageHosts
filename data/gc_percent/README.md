* complete_bacteria_gc.tsv: A table of the locus id, GC base pairs, total base pairs, and %gc for all of the bacterial genomes
* phage.gc.tsv: A table of the locus id, GC base pairs, total base pairs, and %gc for all of the phage genomes
* ncnc.score.tsv: A table of the phage genome, the bacteria genome, and the distance between them (Euclidean distance of %GC). The remaining columns are whether this phage:host pair represent a correct host for the phage at species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, superkingdom
